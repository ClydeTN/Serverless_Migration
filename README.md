# Node.js REST API â€“ Serverless Migration
This project demonstrates the migration of a RESTful API built with Node.js and Express.js to a serverless architecture using AWS Lambda and API Gateway. The goal of the migration is to improve scalability, reduce operational overhead, and optimize cost by leveraging a fully managed, event-driven infrastructure.
